#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}

what is #?

why should we start with word "include "?
why should () be empty?
why isnt giving space necessary ?
why should we use main?
cant we use any other number than 0 in return?
why stdio.h should be in <>?
why should a message be in " and braces ?
what does printf mean?
why doesnt this program have scanf?
why does int only is in short form?
